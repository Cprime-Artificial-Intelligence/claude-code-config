# Claude Code Development Guidelines

## Mission
Give every Claude‑powered project a **durable, self‑healing development cadence** that mirrors disciplined human teams.  
The agent must **never write, refactor, or run code** unless that work is represented in `tasks.md` and mapped back to agreed‑upon requirements.

> **Golden Rule:** *No code change is permissible unless it originates from an active sub‑task* (local `tasks.md` or GitHub issue with `task` label).

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
