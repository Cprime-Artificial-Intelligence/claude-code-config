## Key Artefacts & Obligations

### Local File Method
| File            | Authoritative Purpose | Ownership & Update Rules |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| `requirements.md` | *Source of truth for WHAT to build.*  Contains User Stories in **"As a ‚Ä¶, I want ‚Ä¶, so that ‚Ä¶"** form.  Each story has **3‚Äë10 acceptance criteria** written as **"When ‚Ä¶, then ‚Ä¶, shall ‚Ä¶"** statements. | ‚Ä¢ Auto‚Äëappend / edit whenever the user articulates a new need.<br>‚Ä¢ Keep stories atomic & testable.<br>‚Ä¢ Maintain changelog at bottom. |
| `design.md`     | *Source of truth for HOW to build.*  Records architecture, technology choices, data flows, key diagrams, trade‚Äëoffs, open questions, references. | ‚Ä¢ Must cite corresponding requirement IDs.<br>‚Ä¢ Revise collaboratively with user before any task planning.<br>‚Ä¢ Mark decisions "‚úÖ Locked" when final. |
| `tasks.md`      | *Source of truth for DOING the work.*  A living implementation plan.  Tracks active work items, explorations, and experiments. | ‚Ä¢ Declare what you're working on - features, explorations, or experiments.<br>‚Ä¢ Link work items to requirements when applicable.<br>‚Ä¢ Mark items "‚úî Done" when complete, "üî¨ Experimental" for exploration.<br>‚Ä¢ Update regularly to maintain work visibility.<br>‚Ä¢ Use branches for experimental work when appropriate. |

## Active Work

### User Authentication [req-001, req-002]
- [ ] Research OAuth providers (req-001)
- [‚úî] Draft login UI skeleton (req-002)
- [ ] Implement token refresh (req-001)

### Payment Integration [req-003, req-004]
- [ ] Setup Stripe SDK (req-003)
- [ ] Create checkout flow (req-003)

### Exploration & Experiments
- [üî¨] Test WebSocket performance (branch: websocket-experiment)
- [üî¨] Evaluate alternative auth libraries

### Rogue-like Development Mode
- [‚öîÔ∏è] ACTIVE: Complete auth rewrite (checkpoint: commit a5d06bd)
  - Mode: No incremental commits until feature complete
  - Risk: High - may need full restart from checkpoint
  - Benefit: Fast iteration without commit overhead
```

### Story Format (e.g., `req-001-user-login.md`)
```markdown
# Story req-001: User Login

**As a** registered user  
**I want** to log in with email and password  
**So that** I can access my personal dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria
- When user enters valid credentials, then system shall authenticate and redirect to dashboard
- When user enters invalid credentials, then system shall display error message
- When user fails 3 attempts, then system shall lock account for 15 minutes
